# Backtracking

This repository contains C++ implementations of classic backtracking problems and algorithms.

## 📂 Contents

- `AllCombinationString.cpp` — Generate all permutations of a given string.
- `AllCombinationString2.cpp` — Alternative implementation for string permutations with recursive backtracking.

## 🧠 What is Backtracking?

Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, removing solutions that fail to satisfy the problem constraints at any point in time (backtrack).

It is commonly used in:
- Permutations and combinations
- Sudoku solvers
- N-Queens problem
- Maze solving
- Subset generation

## 🛠️ Requirements

- C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`)
- Command-line interface (Linux/macOS/Windows)

## ▶️ How to Run

Compile the code:
```bash
g++ -o program AllCombinationString.cpp
./program
